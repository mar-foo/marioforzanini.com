# Control
On the one hand cell phones are arguably the most personal computers
since the invention of Personal Computers: most people carry one
around every day and use it multiple hours a day. On the other hand
cell phones are the least user-controllable devices: no one has
administrative access to theirphone, except the companies that sell
it. This means that they can do anything with **your** device:


* [they can remotely install programs on it](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/even-creepier-covid-tracking-google-silently-pushed-app-to-users-phones/)
* [they can remotely uninstall programs on it](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/3358134/Apples-Jobs-confirms-iPhone-kill-switch.html)
* [they can have access to files on them](https://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/replicant-developers-find-and-close-samsung-galaxy-backdoor)
* [they can listen to your conversations](https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Public-Statement-Siri-recordings-TLB.pdf)

Is it really [your](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-34444233) device?

## Obsolescence
Having no control over your device has many potential risks, which I
partially tried to show in the previous section, but another
consequence of it is that people use technology knowing nothing about
it. Today everybody owns a personal computing device, even my
grandmother owns a phone, this means that companies can very easily
design their devices, and most importantly the software that runs on
them, so that after a fixed amount of time trivial computations take
longer and longer to complete. Until the user <i>"realises"</i> that
it's time to buy a new device. If my grandmother's phone suddenly
slows down after an <i>"update"</i> (assuming that she knows what an
update is) she'll probably think that her phone is too old and a new
one would run as quickly as she is accustomed to; I'm sure that she
won't think that the problem <b>could</b> be at the software level (it
could be, we can't know because no one has access to the source code
of most of the programs that run on mobile devices, no matter how much
you know about the subject the best you can do is guess). Given that
my website is hosted on an [Acer KAV10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acer_Aspire_One) from 2008
(UPDATE 10/11/2021: the website is now hosted on a [Raspberry Pi Zero](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero)) I'd
guess that 
[software is the problem](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/24/apple-samsung-fined-for-slowing-down-phones):
her two-year-old phone is probably more capable than this web server
no matter how *old* she's led to think it is.

# Addiction

As I said cell phones are the most personal computers, such
easy access to technology and all its power can be really
useful and does save a lot of time and trouble sometimes, but
it has a cost (other than your privacy). Being constantly
"connected", stimulated and having such an easy access to the
web at all times can be addictive. Some research is being done
on this, here are a few references:

* [phantom vibrations (ever felt like your phone was vibrating but it wasn't?)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3677878/)
* [fear of going without a phone](https://www.healthline.com/health/anxiety/nomophobia)
* [cell addiction and psychological and physiological health in adolescents](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6449671/)

Other than psychological and physiological addictions due to
the use of mobile phones there are also lots of *apps*
(programs) that induce addiction, and having constant access
to them can worsen the situation.

For example most mobile games are engineered to be addictive, as
explained in the first part of [this webpage](http://www.gnu.org/proprietary/proprietary-addictions.html).
Another example of addictive programs are Social Media sites, they
have all adopted the same scheme today: an infinitely scrolling home
page full of ads and non-informative content. Scrolling for hours a
day becomes automatic, it feels very fulfilling: all the content seems
very important and interesting, even though most of it are ads and
videos of cats playing the piano. Other than addiction social media
have a lot of downsides and almost no positives, but that's for
another time (if you are interested you can watch
[this nice video](https://videos.lukesmith.xyz/videos/watch/5e0eeac4-2b38-450c-aad6-eb601087686e)
we all know nobody reads anymore).
